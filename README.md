- 👋 Hi, I’m @38spechul
- 👀 I’m interested in ...learning. I love to learn new things and accept new challenges. I am a self-named artist, with combinations of hippy, gypsy, a bit of cherokee and rebel. An introvert and i love nature.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...new computer skills (at least I think I am)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...pretty much anything
- 📫 How to reach me ...telepathically 
- 😄 Pronouns: ...I am a strong independant woman. 
- ⚡ Fun fact: ...I am a **Master of Procrastination**: I put the "pro" in procrastination —my to-dos list's has a to-do list for my to-do's list and I am also a **Professional Overthinker**: I can analyze every possible scenario in a conversation—especially the ones that never happened!
